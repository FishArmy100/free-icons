# Security Policy

The Free Icons project takes security seriously to ensure the safety and trustworthiness of our repository. We encourage the community to participate in making Free Icons secure for everyone. By following responsible disclosure practices and reporting security vulnerabilities, you help us maintain a safer environment for our users.

## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within the Free Icons project, please follow these guidelines to responsibly disclose it:

1. **Do not** disclose the vulnerability publicly before it has been resolved.

2. Notify us immediately by emailing [defaultcompany0@gmail.com](mailto:defaultcompany0@gmail.com) with the subject line: "Security Vulnerability Report."

3. Provide detailed information regarding the vulnerability, including:

- A clear and concise description of the issue.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability, if applicable.
- Any proof-of-concept (PoC) code or examples that demonstrate the vulnerability.
- Your contact information for further communication.

4. Our security team will acknowledge your report within 5 business days and provide an estimated timeline for resolving the issue.

5. We will maintain open and transparent communication throughout the process, keeping you informed of the progress and any necessary steps.

6. Once the security vulnerability has been resolved, we will credit you for your responsible disclosure if desired, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Responsible Disclosure Principles

To ensure a coordinated and effective response to security vulnerabilities, we kindly request that you adhere to the following principles:

- Do not attempt to exploit any security vulnerabilities beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the existence of the vulnerability.

- Do not intentionally harm the Free Icons project or its users through any malicious actions or attacks.

- Do not access, modify, or delete any data without explicit permission.

- Respect the privacy and security of our users by avoiding any actions that may compromise their personal information.

- Coordinate with us in good faith, and allow sufficient time for the vulnerability to be addressed before disclosing it to others.

## Reward Program

At this time, the Free Icons project does not offer a formal reward program for security vulnerabilities. However, we greatly appreciate your efforts in responsibly disclosing any issues and will publicly acknowledge your contribution if desired.

We value your assistance in improving the security of the Free Icons project and maintaining the trust of our users. Thank you for your commitment to responsible disclosure and helping us create a safer environment.
